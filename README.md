MLB STATS --
This project is a console application in C++. It reads MLB data from a txt file. You can see the format of the txt file in the included txt file. 
There are several options the user can select to see different stats. The user can see all qualified hitters and the top ten hitters in each
of the following stat categories: hits, singles, doubles, triples, home runs, batting average (AVG), on base percentage (OBP), slugging percentage (SLG), 
on base plus slugging (OPS), and stolen bases. The user can also search a player by name to display all stats for the given player. The user
can also compare two different players stats for the year. The stats for each of the two players will be displayed in two columns. There will be
an 'X' by the player's stat that is higher so you can see quickly which player had the better year. the main .cpp file, player .h file, and an
example .txt file are included in the repository. 

The txt file is just a template of how the stats should be formatted. The actual stats and names of players are not included due to 
use restrictions. The data use was obtained from Baseball Savant. You can download a csv file from their website with custom 
data options selected.
